1. Clear description of the problem that is being addressed.

To determine if there exists a genetic signature that classifies promoters, enhancers, insulators and silencers.

2. Significance/Rationale: Why is the addressed problem important?

While there exists some computational tools, mainly deep learning, to discover these mechanisms are impossible to understand. Leaving the makeup of these mechanisms still unknown. No one really understand what sequence defines an enhancer, promoter, silencer or insulator. Knowing what makeup defines each mechanism would assist in the understanding of how these mechanisms influence genetic expression. 

3. Tentative Methods and Approach: What is the planned approach -- does not have to be final.

The planned approach involves the following strategies:
1. Generate a series of k-mers for each sequence (k=1,2,3,4)
2. I will then plot the distribution of k-mers by mechanism type (enhancer, silencer, insulator promoter) as a set of histograms. 
3. I will then find out what features would best differentiate each using Entropy or Linear Regression. 
4. I will then use the best features (k-mers) I will then construct a PCA or TSNE plot to show the separation between each mechanism type. 
5. Finally, I will plot the distribution of best features as a histogram to show what features best differentiate each mechanism type.

4. Expected Set of Results, Outcomes, and Deliverables: Source code/executables, results, algorithms, etc.

There will be several components to the deliverables. The source code (in python) will be submitted in addition to a series of plots (i.e., histograms, TSNE/PCA) that will describe the results.

5. Bibliography/References: Make sure to have at least 20 references in the report. More better.
